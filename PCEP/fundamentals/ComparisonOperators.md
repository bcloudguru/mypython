## Comparision Operators
---
**Equal Operators** -> ==
```
>>> print (2 == 2)
True
>>> print (2. == 2)
True
>>> print ("Hello" == "hello")
False
>>> print ("Hello" == "Hello")
True
>>> print (9 == (3**2))
True
```
---
**Not Equal** -> !=  (Opposite of Equal Operator)
```
>>> print(2 != 2)
False
>>> print(2!=3)
True
>>> print (9 != (3**2))
False
>>> print ("Hello" != "Hello")
False
```
---
**greater than / greater than equal** -> >/>=
```
>>> print ( 2>6)
False
>>> print (2>2)
False
>>> print(2>=2)
True
```
---
**smaller than / smaller than equal** -> >/>=
```
>>> print (2<6)
True
>>> print(2<2)
False
>>> print(2<=2)
True
```
